This is a simple prototype of the classic Minesweeper game built using SwiftUI. The game features an 8x8 grid with randomly placed mines, and players can reveal cells, flag potential mines, and win or lose based on their choices.

## Features

- **Cell Interaction**: Tap to reveal cells and long press to flag potential mines.
- **Adjacent Mine Count**: Displays the number of adjacent mines for each revealed cell.
- **Game Over and Win Conditions**: Detects when the player hits a mine or reveals all non-mine cells.
- **New Game Button**: Restart the game at any time.

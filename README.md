- **Cell Interaction**: Tap to reveal cells and long press to flag potential mines.
- **Adjacent Mine Count**: Displays the number of adjacent mines for each revealed cell.
- **Game Over and Win Conditions**: Detects when the player hits a mine or reveals all non-mine cells.
- **New Game Button**: Restart the game at any time.
